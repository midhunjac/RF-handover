<div>

MICROSOFT AZURE RTOS 

Shape 

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or
one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any Microsoft
services or software updates (except to the extent such services or updates are
accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms
apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to
pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU
HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.  BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. 

1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.  

a) General. You may install and use the software and the included Microsoft
applications solely for internal development, testing and evaluation purposes.
Any distribution or production use requires a separate license as set forth in
Section 2.  

b) Contributions. Microsoft welcomes contributions to this software. In the event
that you make a contribution to this software you will be required to agree to a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and
actually do, grant Microsoft the rights to use your contribution. For details,
visit https://cla.microsoft.com.  

c) Included Microsoft Applications. The software includes other Microsoft
applications which are governed by the licenses embedded in or made available
with those applications.  

d) Third Party Components. The software may include third party components with
separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described
within the software or in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the
software. 

e) Competitive Benchmarking. If you are a direct competitor, and you access or use
the software for purposes of competitive benchmarking, analysis, or intelligence
gathering, you waive as against Microsoft, its subsidiaries, and its affiliated
companies (including prospectively) any competitive use, access, and
benchmarking test restrictions in the terms governing your software to the
extent your terms of use are, or purport to be, more restrictive than
Microsoft’s terms. If you do not waive any such purported restrictions in the
terms governing your software, you are not allowed to access or use this
software, and will not do so. 

2. DISTRIBUTION AND PRODUCTION USE. If you have obtained and/or are developing on
microprocessor(s) and/or microcontroller(s) (“hardware”) listed in the file
named “LICENSED-HARDWARE.txt” included in the repository and/or distributed with
the software you have the following rights in and to the software solely when
used in combination with the hardware. In the event hardware is not listed in
the LICENSED-HARDWARE.txt file, you do not have the rights in this Section 2. 

a) Distribution and Production Use Rights.  

i. You may use the software in production (e.g. program the modified or unmodified
software to devices you own or control) and distribute (i.e. make available to
third parties) the modified or unmodified binary image produced from this code.


ii. You may permit your device distributors or developers to copy and distribute the
binary image as programmed or to be programmed to your devices. 

iii. You may redistribute the unmodified or modified source to your device
distributors or developers. Modifications must be clearly marked. Any
redistribution in source code form must contain this license and any other
licenses that accompany the software. 

b) Requirements. For any code you distribute, you must: 

i. when distributed in binary form, except as embedded in a device, include with
such distribution the terms of this agreement;  

ii. when distributed in source code form to distributors or developers of your
devices, include with such distribution the terms of this agreement; and 

iii. indemnify, defend and hold harmless Microsoft from  any claims, including
attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your devices, except to
the extent that any claim is based solely on the unmodified software. 

c) Restrictions. You may not: 

i. use or modify the software to create a competing real time operating system
software;  

ii. remove any copyright notices or licenses contained in the software; 

iii. use Microsoft’s trademarks or trade dress in your application in any way that
suggests your device or application comes from or is endorsed by Microsoft;  

iv. transfer individual components, specific libraries, classes, functions or code
fragments of the software separately for purposes unrelated to the software; or 

v. use or distribute the software in any way that would subject the software or
Microsoft’s intellectual property or technology to any other license terms. 

3. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all
other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this
limitation, you will not (and have no right to): 

a) remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in
the software; 

b) use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate
malware; or 

c) share, publish, distribute, or lease the software (except as permitted in
Section 2 above), or provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others
to use. 

4. DATA. This software may interact with other Microsoft products that collect data
that is transmitted to Microsoft. To learn more about how Microsoft processes
personal data we collect, please see the Microsoft Privacy Statement at
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=248681. 

5. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export
laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on
destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export
restrictions, visit https://aka.ms/exporting. 

6. SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any
support services for the software. Any support provided is “as is”, “with all
faults”, and without warranty of any kind. 

7. UPDATES. Microsoft may periodically update the software. You may obtain updates
only from Microsoft or Microsoft-authorized sources. Updates may not include or
support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices. 

8. TERMINATION. Without prejudice to any other rights, Microsoft may terminate this
agreement if you fail to comply with any of its terms or conditions. In such
event, you must destroy all copies of the software and all of its component
parts. 

9. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for
supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for
the software. To the extent you have entered into a separate agreement with
Microsoft relating specifically to the software, the terms in such agreement
shall control. 

10. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the software in
the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province where you live
(or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern
the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other
claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims),
regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any
other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction exists, you and
Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in
King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and
Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of
King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. 

11. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal
rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of
your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft,
you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the
software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your
state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the
following provisions apply to you: 

a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and
nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights. 

b) Germany and Austria. 

i. Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as
described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However,
Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software. 

ii. Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence,
claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or
personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.


Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight
negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,
the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the
breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance
with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations").
In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight
negligence. 

12. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF
USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT. 

13. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING
DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT
RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL,
INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. 

This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or
condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in
each case to the extent permitted by applicable law. 

It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or
limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages. 

 

Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in
this agreement are provided below in French. 

Remarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce
contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français. 

EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel
». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft
n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits
additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce
contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les
garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier
et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues. 

LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES
DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une
indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous
ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris
les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices. 

Cette limitation concerne: 

•tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le
code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers; et 

•les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre
de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite
autorisée par la loi en vigueur. 

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître
l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la
limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de
quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion
ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard. 

EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous
pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent
contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si
celles-ci ne le permettent pas.

use in whole or in part of the Licensed Software will be interrupted or error
free, will meet Your requirements, or will operate with the combination of
hardware and software selected by You.

You are responsible for determining whether the Licensed Software will be
suitable for your intended use or application or will achieve your intended
results. ST will not be liable to You and/or to any third party for the
derivative works of the Licensed Software developed by You.

ST has not authorised anyone to make any representation or warranty for the
Licensed Software, and any technical, applications or design information or
advice, quality characterization, reliability data or other services provided by
ST shall not constitute any representation or warranty by ST or alter this
disclaimer or warranty, and no additional obligations or liabilities beyond
those explicitly stated in this Agreement shall arise from ST’s providing such
information or services. ST does not assume or authorize any other person to
assume for it any other liability in connection with the Licensed Software.

Nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed as:

(i) a warranty or representation by ST to maintain production of any ST device
or other hardware or software with which the Licensed Software may be used or to
otherwise maintain or support the Licensed Software in any manner; or

(ii) a commitment from ST and/or its licensors to bring or prosecute actions or
suits against third parties for infringement of any of the rights licensed
hereby, or conferring any rights to bring or prosecute actions or suits against
third parties for infringement. However, ST has the right to terminate this
Agreement immediately upon receiving notice of any claim, suit or proceeding
that alleges that the Licensed Software or Your use or distribution of the
Licensed Software infringes any third party intellectual property rights.

All other warranties, conditions or other terms implied by law are excluded to
the fullest extent permitted by law.

__LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES__

In no event shall ST or its licensors be liable to You or any third party for
any indirect, special, consequential, incidental, punitive damages or other
damages (including but not limited to, the cost of labor, re-qualification,
delay, loss of profits, loss of revenues, loss of data, costs of procurement of
substitute goods or services or the like) whether based on contract, tort, or
any other legal theory, relating to or in connection with the Licensed Software,
the documentation or this Agreement, even if ST has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

In no event shall ST’s liability to You or any third party under this Agreement,
including any claim with respect of any third party intellectual property
rights, for any cause of action exceed 100 US$. This section does not apply to
the extent prohibited by law. For the purposes of this section, any liability of
ST shall be treated in the aggregate.

__TERMINATION__

ST may terminate this Agreement, including its licenses, at any time if You are
in material breach of any of its terms and conditions and You have failed to
cure such breach within 30 (thirty) days after receiving notification from ST of
such breach. Upon termination, You will immediately destroy or return all copies
of the Licensed Software (including without limitation any documentation) to ST.
After termination, Your sole surviving right will be to continue to use the
Licensed Software solely to the extent that it was already incorporated before
Your material breach of this Agreement into Your Products, which were sold by
You before the date of Your material breach.

__APPLICABLE LAW AND JURISDICTION__

This Agreement and matters connected with the validity, interpretation or
performance thereof shall be governed, construed, interpreted, and applied in
all respects by the law in place in Switzerland, without resort to conflict of
laws principles. The Parties expressly agree that the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this
Agreement or to their relationship.

Dispute Resolution. The Parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction in the court
of Canton of Geneva, Switzerland for purposes of any litigation arising from
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this section shall
prevent either Party seeking interim injunctive relief from a court or tribunal
of appropriate jurisdiction.

__SEVERABILITY__

If any provision of this agreement is or becomes, at any time or for any reason,
unenforceable or invalid, no other provision of this agreement shall be affected
thereby, and the remaining provisions of this agreement shall continue with the
same force and effect as if such unenforceable or invalid provisions had not
been inserted in this Agreement.

__WAIVER__

The failure or delay of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement
shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or a subsequent
breach of the same or a different provision.

__ASSIGNMENT__

This Agreement may not be assigned by You, nor any of Your rights or obligations
hereunder, to any third party without prior written consent of ST. In the event
that this Agreement is assigned effectively to a third party, this Agreement
shall bind upon successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

__RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES__

Nothing in this Agreement shall create, or be deemed to create, a partnership or
the relationship of principal and agent or employer and employee between the
Parties. Neither Party has the authority or power to bind, to contract in the
name of or to create a liability for the other in any way or for any purpose.
